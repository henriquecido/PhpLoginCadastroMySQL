## ☕ Using UserAccess

To use UserAccess, follow these steps:

```
To use the login with Google or Facebook it will be necessary to create 
your own ID Client on your platforms, and change the ID Token within
the code by yours, as well as the connection to the bank and the path 
of the composer library, must be updated.

Until now,

Password recovery has not yet been added.
Regular expressions were not implemented in the inputs of the form, and 
the implementation of the language change when clicking on the flags above.

Simple design because the focus was on making it work and serving 
as a template for future applications.
